# alzheimer-disease-detection_using_AI
Alzheimer's Disease is a type of dementia more common in older adults, which is progressive from mild memory loss to loss of various day-to-day functions. It does not have a cure but we can help people suffering from it if we are able to detect it early.
Implementing artificial intelligence methods to detection Alzheimerâ€™s disease as early as possible for the patient.
Here we have appliad CNN on 2d MRI Images of pateints for this study.
We have divided the images into 3 classes - Non-demented (CN-Cognitively Normal), Very Mild Demented (MCI-Mild Cognitive Impairment) and Mild Demented (AD-Alzheimer's Disease).
Our model is 90% accurate.

Please downlaod the files and run samples cases to test the model.
# To run : 
First open the data augmentation and model training file in the python interface.
Make sure to update the filepaths according to where you have downloaded the files in local machine.
After that open the model testing file to test the model and to check the confusion matrix as shown.
Finally, we have predicted the disease of the sample images provided correctly.
